#ALL FUNCTIONS TAKE NUMPY ARRAYS AS INPUT AND RETURN NUMPY ARRAYS!!!!
#Numpy will automatically understand that 1x1 arrays are not arrays and return them correctly
#All Funcitons are static methods that don't require an instance to call them

#If grad is set to True , return the derivative instead

def sigmoid(x , grad = False):
    return None
